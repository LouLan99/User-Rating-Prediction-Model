## Google play store rating predictions for applications
=========================

 Update the Readme file with a bit more introduction to the business problem, and how you will approach it. Introduce your target variable, and which types of information you will use to predict it. Highlight the key stages of data manipulation and the different models you explore. Also fill in the relevant sections of the 'Project Organisation' header with the names of data files and notebooks. Remove the unused sections.

### Project Overview
How might we use machine learning to predict the user rating with the help of
other features of an App.
This project is about creating suitable model to predict the user rating of an application based on its others feature. 
Our target variable is Rating columns which is the average rating of an application. 
Our problem is a regression problem. To solve this problem we will use a Linear Regression Model and Decision Tree Regressor.
